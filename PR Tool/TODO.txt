- Use const qualifier where possible

Before 2019:

- Implement decay
	->Then either:
		- in the Glicko API, when a player exists and the algorithm is called get players that are NOT included in the results
			-> recalculate*Period(s)-method has to create Players in the rating period of their first result 
				-> recalculateAllPeriods right now does:

					- close old world
					- create new empty world
					- go through playerBase and:
						- save old ID of player
						- recreate player in the world and update ID in playerBase
						- "map" new ID to old ID of the player
						- in the "Rating Periods"-tab update the ID(itemData) for the player, if visible
					- recreate results with the mapped IDs
					- go through rating periods and:
						- get results in that period
						- do glicko for those results
						- go through playerBase and:
							- get Glicko-player-equivalent by ID
							- set ratings of playerBase-player to those of the Glicko-player
					- go through playerBase and (if visible):
						- count wins/losses 
						- set stats in "Rating Periods"-tab
					- sort "Rating Periods"-tab ranking table

				instead do:
					- close old world 
					- create new empty world
					- go through rating periods and:
						- get results from period
						- go through those results and:
							- check if players exist (getbyid == -1)
							- if not existing, create
							- map ID
							- update ID in "Rating Periods"-tab (takes ID AND string-alias so IDs may temporarily exist twice)
							- algorithm for those results (only created players are valid to be replaced)
						- technically rating values will have to be updated here, but IDs might be duplicate right? (use string alias too???)
						- go through playerBase and (if visible):
							- count wins/losses 
							- set stats in "Rating Periods"-tab
							- sort "Rating Periods"-tab ranking table

Implement ties... yes, i reconsidered... the Glicko-2 API should be exactly that, so it has to implement ties. Plus, GGScore can then...
  ... be used for many more competitive disciplines
  -> Let ties be imported via challonge-brackets
  -> Let ties be created via "Add result..."-button
