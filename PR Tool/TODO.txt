TODO
								
- Use const qualifier where possible

- Change the entries of the playerBase-vector to structs. Same for results and periods maybe... (just two fields, so no priority...
  ...or maybe even uneccessary).

- When finalizing ratings save the wins and losses per player (another field in the player-tuple? D=) to display the stats in the...
  ..."rating periods"-tab correctly.
