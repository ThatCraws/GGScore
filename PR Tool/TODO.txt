TODO
								
- Use const qualifier where possible

- Use wxUnused where possible (mainly the event-handling methods)

- Show statistics in "Player Edit"

- Check if two results with same player 1, player 2, winner and date, but different description are always properly removed...
	-> else check for description as well when removing results... probably make a remove-/addResult-method as well...
