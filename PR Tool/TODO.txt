TODO
								
- Use const qualifier where possible

- Change stuff to structs. Maybe results(Result, date), ratingPeriods(start, end)

- When finalizing ratings save the wins and losses per player (another field in the player-tuple? D=) to display the stats in the...
  ..."rating periods"-tab correctly.
